# Heap

### A Heap is a **special Tree**-based data structure in which the tree is a **complete binary tree**.

## Types  
-------
![Min Heap](../images/tree/min_max_heap.bmp "Min Heap Tree")

### Min Heap
- The node value present at the root node must be **minimum** among the node values present at all of it’s children. 
- The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. 

### Max Heap
- The node value present at the root node must be **highest** among the node values present at all of it’s children. 
- The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
