# Types of graphs

## Directed
- In directed graphs, edges point from the node at one end to the node at the other end. In undirected graphs, the edges simply connect the nodes at each end.

## Undirected
- In undirected graphs, the edges simply connect the nodes at each end.

## Cyclic or acyclic
- A graph is cyclic if it has a cycle—an unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or edges that connects back to itself. Graphs without cycles are acyclic.

## Weighted or unweighted 
- A graph is cyclic if it has a cycle—an unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or edges that connects back to itself. Graphs without cycles are acyclic.
